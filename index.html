<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Roy Ocskasy</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

  <div class="hero-text">

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I study Digital Narrative and Interactive Design along with a creative writing minor. I'm currently a junior at the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. I'm sorta hope all over the place with my major, I started on the game design track but I wouldn't say that game design is all I care about. I absolutely love any of electronic literature, especially studying hypertext pieces! So that's basically it with what I study, fun funky things you make with computers!</h3>
  </div>



<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I know a little bit about coding, I would never say I'm amazing at it! Although DNID is a mixture of english and coding, I'm a much more english leaning person! But I have experience with making a couple different games, though I've only coded 25% or less of them! I mostly do the art, that's what I love! Bright colors and odd expressions, I find illustration to be awesome and a great way to show off how I see the world! I've got varying skills in writing, coding, and illustrating which allow me to present my imagination in different ways</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>There are two different kinds of good design that I can think of, but there is definitely more than that. The first one is design that is accessible to its users/viewers. The design offers itself to be used/viewed efficiently by all different kinds of people, such as those who may or may not suffer from a disability. Can those who are colorblind access it with the same efficiency as those who aren't? Question like those should be answered with a yes if it is good design.
        Another good design relies on the aesthetics that please the viewer. Everyone has a different interpretation of what good design is. For example, I hate the UI of Photoshop, I don't find it to be user-friendly, yet it is the industry standard so many others probably find it to be good design despite me thinking otherwise. It differs from person to person, but keep in mind that this version of "good design" is just based on aesthetics. There are different categories of good design. Good design can range from accessibility to aesthetics to efficiency to usability and so on.

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>Despite studying digital design, my biggest career interest is working in comics either as an artist or a writer. Game design comes in second, I still love it despite it being second place in my mind and I will probably start any career I can get with what I learned after I finish up school. However, in the end I would love to work in comics, I find the art in them to be incredibly powerful. Having the mind imagine the space between the panels and derive emotion from a static shot is amazing. I've cried to so many beautiful comics in the past, and I want to make something like that in my future. Perhaps this space will teach me about new ways of seeing in my design. How can I make my work more accessible? What do people like to see more when it comes to aestehtics, but how can I still keep hints of me within that? I'm rather excited to learn more about "good design"!</h3>
